# Requirements
This project has been developed on a machine running Windows 10 23H2 in Visual Studio Community 2022. It's compiled for Windows 10/11, but you should be able to compile it to your own platform.
Specifications wise, this game is really not that intensive. It uses a small amount of CPU, GPU, and RAM. Should even run on a pentium in my opinion.
# Introduction
Welcome to **4-Key Rhythm Game**. This is an Rhythm game with 4 lanes inspired by games such as osu!mania, Quaver, DDR, Robeats! and StepManiaX! If you're not familiar with that, that is no problem! The game introduces 4 lanes, each lane corrosponding to an arrow. Your goal is to click the falling arrow on the right timing when it overlaps the existing arrow on the bottom. The arrows will fall on the rhythm of the song which you will be hearing, so playing with audio will be advised!
